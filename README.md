# Calculator Project

Here is the calculator I will model my project off:

## MVP (Summarised):

### Javascript

-   Our calculator should render a calculation in a display
-   it should also handle decimals

### HTML & CSS

-   An image of a calculator from the internet will be reproduced using HTML & CSS
-   Number keys 1-9 (including 0), operator keys (+, -, x, % etc) and period key (.) should be usable
-   Order of operations does not need to be supported
